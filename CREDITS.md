# Acknowledgement

The projects that inspired me a lot into making this library project a success.

Big thanks to all of you for your hardwork and dedication in community.
By combining all of your efforts, I came to realization about many unique things of GPGPU and SIMD architecture.
As always, learning is a journey and heterogeneous computing is the future.
